# bson-deno

![deno build & tests](https://github.com/thekorn/bson-deno/actions/workflows/deno.yml/badge.svg)

**Note: this is in a highly experimental state**

Port of the [js-bson](https://github.com/mongodb/js-bson.git) library to deno,
with the goal of feature compatibility and completeness with upstream.

This port has been autogenerated from the upstream `js-bson` by this
[build tool](https://github.com/thekorn/deno-build-mongodb-native) - please
don't make any manual changes to this repository, esp to `./_src` and report any
bugs either to the build tool, or even
[upstream](https://github.com/mongodb/js-bson)

## known issues

- [ ] types cannot be initialized as function calls
- [ ] the `BSON.Timestamp` type has a broken initializer
- [ ] Buffer serialization is broken
- [ ] we have a few skipped test cases
